  History of clowns
</h3>
<h4>

        Clowns have a varied tradition with significant variations in costume and performance. The most recognisable modern clown character is the Auguste or
        "red clown" type, with outlandish costumes featuring distinctive makeup, colourful wigs, exaggerated footwear, and colourful clothing.
        Modern clowns are strongly associated with the tradition of the circus clown, which developed out of earlier comedic roles in theatre or Variet√© shows during the 19th to mid 20th centuries.

Many circus clowns have become well known and are a key circus act in their own right.<br/> <br/>
        The first mainstream clown role was portrayed by Joseph Grimaldi (who also created the traditional whiteface make-up design). <br/>
        In the early 1800s, he expanded the role of Clown in the harlequinade that formed part of British pantomimes, notably at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane and the Sadler's Wells and Covent Garden theatres. He became so
        dominant on the London comic stage that harlequinade Clowns became known as "Joey", and both the nickname and Grimaldi's whiteface make-up design were,
        and still are, used by other types of clowns. <br/>
